\section*{Problem Statement}
A G.P consists of an even number of terms. If the sum of all terms is 5 times the sum of terms occupying odd places, then find its common ratio.

\section*{Solution}
Let \( X(0) \) denote the first term of the geometric progression and \( r \) the common ratio. The sum of a geometric progression with \( n \) terms can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = X(0) \frac{{r^n - 1}}{{r - 1}} \]

The nth term (\(x(n)\)) in the series starting from \(n = 0\) in the geometric progression is given by:
\[ x(n) = X(0) \cdot \left(\frac{{5 + \sqrt{21}}}{2}\right)^{\frac{n}{2}} \times (u(n))\]

The series starting from \(n = 0\) in the geometric progression is represented as:
\[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x(n) = X(0) + X(0) \cdot r + a \cdot r^2 + \dots = \frac{X(0)}{1 - r} \times (u(n))\]
where \( r = \left(\frac{{5 + \sqrt{21}}}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \)

The sum of terms occupying odd places (i.e., at positions 1, 3, 5, ...) in a geometric progression can be represented as:
\[ S_{\text{odd}} = X(0) \frac{{r^{(n/2)} - 1}}{{r - 1}} \]

Given that the sum of all terms (\( S_{2n} \)) is 5 times the sum of terms occupying odd places (\( S_{\text{odd}} \)), we can set up the equation:
\[ X(0) \frac{{r^{2n} - 1}}{{r - 1}} = 5 \cdot X(0) \frac{{r^n - 1}}{{r - 1}} \]

Simplifying by canceling out the common term \( X(0) \) and dividing both sides by \( r - 1 \):
\[ r^{2n} - 1 = 5 \cdot r^n - 5 \]
\[ r^{2n} - 5 \cdot r^n + 1 = 0 \]

Let \( x = r^n \), then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \( x \):
\[ x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0 \]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( x \), we can find \( r \) as \( x^{1/n} \). Using the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{{5 \pm \sqrt{21}}}{2} \]

Since \( x = r^n \), \( r = x^{1/n} \), and considering \( n \) is a positive even number, we take the positive root:
\[ r = \left(\frac{{5 + \sqrt{21}}}{2}\right)^{1/n} \]

This gives the common ratio \( r \) in terms of \( n \), the number of terms in the geometric progression.
Let's assume a sequence \( x(n) \) given by \( x(n) = X(0)^n u(n) \), where \( X(0) \) is a constant and \( u(n) \) is the unit step function.

The Z-transform is given by:
\[ X(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x(n)z^{-n} = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (X(0)z^{-1})^n = \frac{1}{1 - X(0)z^{-1}} \]

This represents the Z-transform for the given sequence \( x(n) = X(0)^n u(n) \).
\section*{Desired Sum Using $X(z)$}
The Z-transform of the sequence \( x(n) = X(0)^n u(n) \) is given by:
\[ X(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x(n)z^{-n} = \frac{1}{1 - az^{-1}} \]

To obtain the desired sum, let's perform the inverse Z-transform by expressing \( X(z) \) in partial fractions:
\[ X(z) = \frac{1}{1 - X(0)z^{-1}} = \frac{A}{1 - az^{-1}} \]

To find \(A\), multiply both sides by the denominator:
\[ 1 = A(1 - X(0)z^{-1}) \]
\[ A = 1 \]

Therefore, the partial sum using \(X(z)\) is \(x(n) = X(0)^n u(n)\).
